# Collection of my work

I worked for a lot of clients over my career.  A lot of time I couldn't share the source code for my work, but these are safe tidbits from some long forgotten projects that I managed to find on my old backups.

## 2012

[Jetpack Elf](2012/jetpack-elf/index.html)

An elf for a 2012 holiday site.  The original version used an early version of GSAP to do the swaying and bopping of the elf.  I've since converted it to standard css. In the large project she would fly around the screen as you interacted with elements.  A simple animation, but it still brings joy.
