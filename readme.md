# Collection of my work

I worked for a lot of clients over my career.  A lot of time I couldn't share the source code for my work, but these are safe tidbits from some long forgotten projects that I managed to find on my old backups.

## 2012

[Jetpack Elf](2012/jetpack-elf/index.html)

An elf for a 2012 holiday site.  The original version used an early version of GSAP to do the swaying and bopping of the elf.  I've since converted it to standard css. In the large project she would fly around the screen as you interacted with elements.  A simple animation, but it still brings joy.

[One Small Tweet](2012/onesmalltweet/)

Shortly after Neil Armstrong passed away a couple of coworkers got together to build a tribute site to honor his legacy. We allowed people to tweet tribute messages and displayed them on the journey to the moon. I had a lot of fun building the frontend and creating raw SVG code to make an interesting looking path.  Unfortunately I don't have the final dataset or the server side API code any more.

## 2017

[Tiny Room](2017/tinyroom/)

I'm super proud of this one.  I was able to take a room customization tool that I wrote for a website and shrink it down to fit inside a banner ad.
